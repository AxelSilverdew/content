[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) is a software utility for software deployment, package management and application virtualization. It provides a sandbox environment in which users can run applications in isolation from the rest of the system.



## Advantages of Using Flatpak

* Flatpaks are distro agnostic. Developers can distribute their application on every Linux distribution simultaneously with ease.
* Flatpaks provide consistent environments. Developers can develop and test applications in environments that are identical to the one users have.
* Flatpak's build tools are simple and very easy to use. A link to the full documentation can be found in the "Further Reading" section below.
* Flatpak runtimes provide stable sets of dependencies that can be used by applications.
* Dependencies that aren't in a runtime can be bundled as part of an application. Versions of the dependencies that are used can be fixed and patched.
* Flatpaks are future-proof. Runtimes are forward compatible, irrespective of distribution changes. Flatpak applications run on new Linux distribution versions as they are released.
